                    <p>Hi, my name is Moyhour Ang, I was borned and raised in Cambodia. Currenly I am working as a Web Developer in Phnome Penh.</p>
                    <p>In 2010 I have graduated from the 4-years English for Professional Communication Program at Institude of Foreign Languages(IFL) in Cambodia. You probably wonder why I am in Web Devlopment since I have gratuated from an English Program. Long story short, after gratuating from IFL, I went to Canada to continue my study. During my stay, I got introduced to programming by my husband and I love it since then. </p>
                    <p>From there, I have self-taughted myself for almost two and half years now, so for my technical skill I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Bower, Grunt, Java and XML. I am also able to do backend work using PHP and MySQL. For graphics, I use both Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I use Git for all my version control needs. I have basic video editing abilities using Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas. Ubuntu (Linux) is my operating system of choice, but of course I can also use Windows. I am constantly learning new tools and languages.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, I love to ice skate, play snooker, read books and also play Street Fighter semi-professionally. No matter what the activity, I'm always open to new challenges and will always strive to be the best. This is the trait that has driven me to where I am today, and also what will always keep me going.</p>
                    <p><strong>This is not just my job, it is my passion.</strong></p>
